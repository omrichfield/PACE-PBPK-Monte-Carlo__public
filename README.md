# PACE-PBPK
 Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of poly amine coester nanoparticle biodistribution in mice

Repository contains data to train the model, data generated by the model, and the R scripts used to generate the model. 

File overview:

FACS_IVIS_data_analysis_20230426.R : accesses biodistribution data located in data_for_model folder and analyzes it to create relative biodistribution data used in training the model. 

funcs.R : functions called by the model, including the system of ordinary differential equations solved using odesolve.

libs.R : associated libraries required to run the model. 

main.R : the main file that fits the model to the data using Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS)

parms.R : parameters associated with the model that are not fit to the data (prior information)

plot_figs.m : a Matlab script that produces the figures associated with our Nature Communications publication. 

Folder overview:

> data_for_model: contains raw data used in training the model to produce output detailed in our Nature Communications publication. 

> figures: figures generated by plot_figs.m 

> model_generated_data: data generated by the model which is accessed by plot_figs.m to produce figures. 

Code instructions:

Run the main.R file, section by section, to reproduce the parameterization used in our Nature Communications publication.
